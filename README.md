# AndroidListView
Simple view made with a custom arrayadapter for the listview. I made this so that i can have a nice platform for a scoreboard view.

The Listview is the primary and only view. I then utilised an ArrayList for this example and an ArrayAdapter class which i then modified to fit my needs. I also made a xml layout for the showing of individual pieces from the arraylist. Nice steady for the whole list and then a transparent background on the xml listitem view. Nice and efficient and can be molded easily! :)
